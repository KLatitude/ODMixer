# ODMixer: Fine-grained Spatial-temporal MLP for Metro Origin-Destination Prediction

Metro Origin-Destination (OD) prediction is a crucial yet challenging spatial-temporal prediction task in urban
computing, which aims to accurately forecast cross-station ridership for optimizing metro scheduling and enhancing overall
transport efficiency. Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive
relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro OD
prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the stationâ€™s perspective
or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches
may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading
to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To
address these challenges, we analyze traffic variations from the
perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatialtemporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely
ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure
and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the
Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture
short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view
Mixer concentrates on capturing relations from both origin and
destination perspectives. To model long-term temporal relations,
we introduce the Bidirectional Trend Learner. Extensive experiments on two large-scale metro OD prediction datasets HZMOD
and SHMO demonstrate the advantages of our ODMixer.
